Example to query the Wikipedia API 

#### Development archived 
This version had the idea to use user accounts to store word lookups, but the universe didn't want to develop the idea further. The version I'm more interested in is here https://github.com/enfrte/wikipedia-search-no-backend and is quite useful for me.
